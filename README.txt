Optical Music Recognition


Week 1 - Discussion / Exploration

Discussed potential scope for the project in order to make sure that the project
is significantly enough to be considered.

Begin exploring existing packages/software that could be used as part of the
project.

Week 2 & 3

Further discussion uncovered some of the difficulties associated with the task:
 Symbol types
 OCRs (triplets)
 Transition of symbols (sharps, flats, naturals, connectors, etc...)

Certain assumptions applied to simplify the task
 Semi automatic approach - Where the staves are, Where the notes are
 One instrument only

Gamera Project's stave removal had problem - it removes any single black line
 Causes random white blank spots in the middle of symbols

If ML method is used to do the symbol detection, the data can be generated by
going through some of the existing musics that are converted to musicXML by the
authors.

Week 4
 Stave removal finished - start on symbol detections
 Use cross-correlation first

Week 5
 Decided whether or not to use ML method (Start generating data now if so)
